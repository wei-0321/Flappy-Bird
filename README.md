# Flappy-Bird
An implementation of Flappy Bird with python pygame. 

# Overview 
I loved to plays lots of games when I was young, and I am so confused about how these games were made.

That was why I made this little project after learning pygame.

(My coding skill was not that good about two years ago, so the code might looks messy. sorry about that.)
